# What I learned about nodejs and backend development?

1. In an ".env" file, you cannot initiate a line with "0". 
2. The following code, removes spaces from user input:

>```str = str.replace(/\s/g, '');```

3. To produce hashes from command line do the following:


> `~$ echo -n "string" | sha256sum` 

You can use the above secret key to stop your robot from outside of the workstation that's running its back-end engine. 
4. You use require() in Node.js and import in the browser.
5. JavaScript is generally considered an interpreted language, but modern JavaScript engines no longer just interpret JavaScript, they compile it.
6. If we run the `node` command without any script to execute or without any arguments, we start a REPL session. REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop, and it is a programming
   language environment (basically a console window).
